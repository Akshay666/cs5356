Assignment 2: Building RESTful Endpoints and Continuous Integration
---------------------------------------------------------

This assignment is the first step towards building a functional backend for
the final project---building a receipt storage and indexing service. We will
create a simple set of REST APIs as follows. 

(`@variable` denotes a value of a variable. The type of the variable should be
clear from the context.)

1. `POST /user` body `{username=@x; password=@y}`  
    Registers a user with username `@x` and password `@y`. If a user already
    exists with the same username, the system should throw an error.  
    Returns 200 for success, and 400 for Failure.
2. `POST /receipt` body `{image=@image, name=@name, tags=@tags}`    
    Stores the submitted receipt image, name, tags (if any) in the db, and 
    runs optical character recognition (OCR) on it using [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/).
    This call should return a receipt id immediately, which can be used to fetch the OCR output later using
     `GET /receipt/#/receiptid`.  
3. `PUT /receipt/#/tags` body `{tags=@tags}`  
   Adds tags to a receipt.
   Returns success (200) or failure (400).
4. `PUT /receipt/#/receiptid` body `{receipt=@image}`  
   Same as the 2, but this time an existing receipt is updated as opposed to creating
   a new receipt.  Returns success (200) or failure (400).
5. `GET /receipt`  
   Returns an ordered list of receiptids stored so far.
6. `GET /receipt/#/receiptid`  
  Get (all) the details of a receipt. 

This is a very simple set of APIs to give the flavour of REST architecture. 
We will not worry about errands such as session management and access control. 
So, anyone can read / write any receipt. Return error (400) on wrong receipt
id for put and get requests.

In the second part of the assignment, you need to setup a [CircleCI]() integration
with your git repo, and add a badge to the README.md file in your repository. 
`GET /` on your server should return the link your GitHub repository for this
assignment.
