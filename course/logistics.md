### Grading

(TBD)
<!--
Your grade in the course will be determined by a sum of points you individually earn.

You can accumulate points by doing the homework and building a great project.  The majority of the points are earned through doing the project.  If you work individually, point-accounting is trivial.  If you work as a team, the points you earn are determined by the product of the *points for the work* x *your understanding of the work*.  Points for the work and your understanding for the work will be judged in an in-person interview taking ~20 mins during finals week, by class staff.

There are 5 buckets you can earn points in, based on the *scope*, *quality* and *your understanding* of the work.
-->

The buckets are:

1. *Front-End* (includes web and mobile clients)
2. *Back-End* (e.g. a MVC system or REST API)
3. *Processing* (e.g. non-trivial algorithms, data processing, bitcoin interaction, ML systems)
4. *Storage* (e.g. S3, Databases)
5. *DevOps* (e.g. Continuous Integration, Deployment and Monitoring, SDLC infrastructure)

You can earn 3 points per bucket per project.

* 1 point for a working basic system, aka a "Hello World"
* 2 points for achieving a level of proficiency
* 3 points for demonstrating advanced capabilities
